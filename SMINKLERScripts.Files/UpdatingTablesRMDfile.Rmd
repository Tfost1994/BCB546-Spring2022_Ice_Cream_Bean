I am trying to update my tables from python to see if I can get them to look any closer to the published tables. 

```install.packages("kableExtra")
```
## This package was used by another group member to obtain tables that closely resemebed author tables.

```setwd("~/Final Project")
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot)
library(kableExtra)
options(knitr.table.format = "html")
```
```table2<-read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sminkler/BCB546-Spring2022_Ice_Cream_Bean_SMinkler/main/SMINKLERScripts.Files/Table_2%20(2).txt", header=T)
table3<-read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sminkler/BCB546-Spring2022_Ice_Cream_Bean_SMinkler/main/SMINKLERScripts.Files/Table_3.txt")```
## I downloaded all of the necessary packages to try to update my tables and loaded my table files from github into my R-project.
```kbl(table2) %>%
+     kable_paper(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
kbl(table3) %>%
+     kable_paper(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)```
### Trying to get my columns and rows to better align and look cleaner. I think because these were first done in python, and then exported as a txt.file, they aren't as compatible with R. I couldn't get a lot of the other functions in the kableextra program to work or look good.
