# Table 1 & Table S1

In this folder should be an R markdown file 'Table1.Rmd' which contains the script necessary to produce both Table 1 and Table S1 from Peng et al. (2015).

Table1.Rmd depends on data located at ../data_files/Supplemental_data _1.xls'

Outputs from Table1.Rmd include two html files. One for Table 1 and another for Table S1.
