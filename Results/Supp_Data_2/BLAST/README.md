### Directory
`BCB546-Spring2022_Ice_Cream_Bean/Results/Supp_Data_2`  

Contains directories resulting from running code to replicate Supplemental file 2.
## Required Code
Objects generated in this directory originate from code file

1. `../../../Code/Supp_Data_2.md`

`Supp_Data_2.md` depends on `../../../data_files/Arabidopsis_Flowering_Protein_Seq.fasta`

## Object descriptions

`ATdb/`: Subdirectory for *Arabidopsis Thaliana* blast database
`HVdb/`: Subdirectory for *Hordeum vulgare* blast database
`TAdb/` Subdirectory for *Triticum aestivum* blast database
`Output/`: Subdirectory for intermediate files
`Arabidopsis_Flowering_Protein_Seq.fasta`: Flowering gene protein sequences obtained from TAIR using Supplemental file 1 gene names
`README.md`: Current file

## Database Subdirectories
**Note:** Subdirectories ending in db contain README files originating from the downloaded protein sequences from Ensembl FTP. These subdirectories contain protein sequence files and database files generated from makeblastdb. `ATdb` `HVdb` and `TAdb` are not described further elsewhere.
