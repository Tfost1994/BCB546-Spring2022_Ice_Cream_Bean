Title: _Genome-Wide Comparative Analysis of Flowering-Related Genes in Arabidopsis, Wheat, and Barley_
Authors: Fred Y. Peng,1 Zhiqiu Hu,2 and Rong-Cai Yang, 2015.
Published in International Journal of Plant Genomics.
The authors examined flowering genes two different plant species; wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)  Because the genomes of these two species are large and complicated, identification of specific flowering genes was difficult. In order to predict these  genes, the authors used known flowering genes from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In total, they identified 900 and 275 flowering genes in wheat and barley. These putative genes were clustered into 144 ortholog groups and showed that orthologous gene pairs in three flowering gene families; PEBP, MADS, and BBX. Now that these flowering genes have been identified, they can be used in breeding to induce early flowering wheat and barley, increasing grain yield and quality in these two species.
